# Learning Haskell 

This is my first time programming in the functional programming language Haskell. 

So that being said, this is going to be a repo with a lot code ranging
from a variety of topics covered in the book Learn You a Haskell. 

Eventually I'll transition this repo into a place for my Haskell projects.
